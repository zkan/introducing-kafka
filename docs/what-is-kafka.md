# What is Kafka?

Kafka is an open-source fault-tolerant, robust distributed event streaming
platform. A single Kafka node is called a *broker*, and multiple Kafka servers
make up a *cluster*. Kafka stores messages written by *producers* in *topics*.
*Consumers* subscribe to topics and contact Kafka to see if messages are
available in those subscribed topics.
